                <h3>My Story</h3>
                <p>If you’re a photographer, you need a very different website from an online store owner, or a dentist, or a
                restaurant…you need one that puts your photographs front-and-center, without any distractions. A website with a “wow”
                effect.
                
                There are lots of ways to create your own photography site—one that’s as distinctive as your own style. Take a look and
                see how these photographers did it.</p>
