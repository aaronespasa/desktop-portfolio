                <p>Anyone can cook, but there is more to cooking than simply throwing ingredients together and hoping for the best. You
                have to understand basic cooking terms and techniques. Knowing how to prepare different components of a meal, and in
                what order, can help you get the timing just right, and prevent things from cooling too quickly. Once you have the
                basics down, you can improve the flavor and texture of your meals with various sauces, herbs, and other seasonings.</p>
