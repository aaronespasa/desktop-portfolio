                <h3>My Story</h3>
                <p>The art of barbering has revitalized in recent years, perhaps thanks to a turning away from the long, uncut look of the
                '60s and '70s and a return to classic cuts and close shaves.[1] Once you complete a barbering program, get your state
                license, and build reliable clientele, you can be sure to count on your customers regularly. Hair, much like time and
                tide, stops for no man. Armed with your hair-snips, clippers, and straight razor, you are just the person for this job.</p>
